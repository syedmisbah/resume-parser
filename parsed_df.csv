Developed the “Credit-Site Intercept Dashboard” on Microsoft Power BI based upon the insights collected from the customer feedbacks on D&B’s product “Credit-Site Intercept”. This dashboard was a snapshot which can help one to drill down the sentiment of customers (Positive, Negative, Neutral) based on their experience with the company 2. Developed the “ESG Risk Report” on Microsoft Power BI which captures the three central factors (E-Environmental, S-Social, and G-Governance) in measuring the sustainability and societal impact of an investment in a company or business. It also gives a snapshot of supplier portfolio and information based on E, S and G factors. 3. Developed the “Cyber Security Dashboard” on Microsoft Power BI .This provides a snapshot of the number of companies which are liable to cyber breach and the severity of the breach. The dashboard gives insights by grouping the various companies under low and high risk buckets based on cyber breach. One can also drill down the dashboard using Industry and Employee Buckets to understand more about the cyber breach impact.
